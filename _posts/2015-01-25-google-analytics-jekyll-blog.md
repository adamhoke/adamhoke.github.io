##Adding Google Analytics to a Jekyll blog for visitor tracking


**Visitor Tracking**

Visitor tracking is important to blog owners because it helps them assesss the value of the content they provide.
Metrics that are commonly tracked about visitors are (but not limited to):

* Traffic sources
* Unique visitors vs return visitors
* Time spent on site
* Pages visited / exit page
* Bounce rate


**Google Analytics**

In my opinion, the best tool to use is Google Analytics.
It's free and widely accepted as the de-facto way to prove traffic statistics about a site.
Sign up at [http://www.google.com/analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics "Google Analytics") by using your google account to add your site information.
After you sign up and are logged in, you'll be taken to the dashboard and focused on the page with your tracking code, that'll be added to Jekyll:
